        "\n",
        "Uncle Steve, the store's owner, needs to better understand the store's customers. In particular, he wants to know what kind of customers shop at the store. He wants to know the main types of *customer personas*. Once he knows these, he will contemplate ways to better market to each persona, better satisfy each persona, better cater to each persona, increase the loyalty of each persona, etc. But first, he must know the personas.\n",
        "\n",
        "You want to help Uncle Steve. Using sneaky magic (and the help of Environics), you've collected four useful features for a subset of the customers: age, income, spending score (i.e., a score based on how much they’ve spent at the store in total), and savings (i.e., how much money they have in their personal bank account). \n",

        "1. Pick a clustering algorithm (the [`sklearn.cluster`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/classes.html#module-sklearn.cluster) module has many good choices, including [`KMeans`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.cluster.KMeans.html#sklearn.cluster.KMeans), [`DBSCAN`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.cluster.DBSCAN.html#sklearn.cluster.DBSCAN), and [`AgglomerativeClustering`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.cluster.AgglomerativeClustering.html#sklearn.cluster.AgglomerativeClustering) (aka Hierarchical). (Note that another popular implementation of the hierarchical algorithm can be found in SciPy's [`scipy.cluster.hierarchy.linkage`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.cluster.hierarchy.linkage.html).) Don't spend a lot of time thinking about which algorithm to choose - just pick one. Cluster the customers as best as you can, within reason. That is, try different feature preprocessing steps, hyperparameter values, and/or distance metrics. You don't need to try every single posssible combination, but try a few at least. Measure how good each  model configuration is by calculating an internal validation metric (e.g., [`calinski_harabasz_score`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.calinski_harabasz_score.html) or [`silhouette_score`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.silhouette_score.html#sklearn.metrics.silhouette_score)).\n",
        "2. You have some doubts - you're not sure if the algorithm you chose in part 1 is the best algorithm for this dataset/problem. Neither is Uncle Steve. So, choose a different algorithm (any!) and do it all again.\n",
        "3. Which clustering algorithm is \"better\" in this case? Think about charateristics of the algorithm like quality of results, ease of use, speed, interpretability, etc. Choose a winner and justify to Uncle Steve.\n",
        "4. Interpret the clusters of the winning model. That is, describe, in words, a *persona* that accurately depicts each cluster. Use statistics (e.g., cluster means/distributions), examples (e.g., exemplar instances from each cluster), and/or visualizations (e.g., relative importance plots, snakeplots) to get started. Human judgement and creativity will be necessary. This is where it all comes together. Be descripive and *help Uncle Steve understand his customers better*. Please!\n",

        "\n",
        "- Since clustering is an unsupervised ML technique, you don't need to split the data into training/validation/test or anything like that. Phew!\n",
        "- On the flip side, since clustering is unsupervised, you will never know the \"true\" clusters, and so you will never know if a given algorithm is \"correct.\" There really is no notion of \"correctness\" - only \"usefullness.\"\n",
        "- Many online clustering tutorials (including some from Uncle Steve) create flashy visualizations of the clusters by plotting the instances on a 2-D graph and coloring each point by the cluster ID. This is really nice and all, but it can only work if your dataset only has exactly two features - no more, no less. This dataset has more than two features, so you cannot use this technique. (But that's OK - you don't need to use this technique.) \n",
        "- Must you use all four features in the clustering? Not necessarily, no. But \"throwing away\" quality data, for no reason, is unlikely to improve a model.\n",
        "- Some people have success applying a dimensionality reduction technique (like [`sklearn.decomposition.PCA`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.decomposition.PCA.html)) to the features before clustering. You may do this if you wish, although it may not be as helpful in this case because there are only four features to begin with.\n",
        "- If you apply a transformation (e.g., [`MinMaxScaler`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler.html) or [`StandardScaler`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.StandardScaler.html#sklearn.preprocessing.StandardScaler)) to the features before clustering, you may have difficulty interpretting the means of the clusters (e.g., what is a mean Age of 0.2234??). There are two options to fix this: first, you can always reverse a transformation with the `inverse_transform` method. Second, you can just use the original dataset (i.e., before any prepropoceesing) during the interpreation step.\n",
        "- You cannot change the distance metric for K-Means. (This is for theoretical reasons: K-Means only works/makes sense with Euclidean distance.\n"

        "I believe Hierarchical is the best clustering model to implement. Both the model has the same silhouette score. So scoreing wise, we can conclude that both model is indffrient. As we can see from the dataset, there are only 505 instances in the data, with 4 features. Hierarchical clustering is capable viewing clusters on dendrogram at various granuralities.One of the disadvantage of Hierarchical method is that if the dataset is too large, Hierarchical will be hard to implement as it will take up too much resources in terms of time and money. Since we can see that in this dataset, we have 4 features and we want to use all of them in our clustering algorthims, Hierarchical seems to be the best method to inpterpret.  In this dataset, we have 4 features with 505 instances, Hierarchical would not be too costly in terms of resources to implement, and it will be able to show detail analysis. One thing that I really like about Hierarchical is that we do not need to determine the K value like in K mean, or estimate multiple parameters like we did in Dbscan. We can use dendrogram, it provides the tree based graph that allows me see how different sub-clusters relate to each other, and how far apart data points are.\n",

I repeat: there is no data for this question.\n",

But using your brain to come up with rules that meet certain criteria, on the other hand, is a true test of whether you understand how the algorithm works, what support and confidence mean, and the applicability of rules. The question uses the grocery store context because most, if not all, students should be familiar from personal experience.\n",

        "I used to go to the gym 5 days a weeek before COVID-19, I was really strict with my diet. Based on my past experience these two products occur often in the grocery store because it helps people control their diet easily. Every time that I go to the grocery store, these two products would usually sells out really quick, which is why I consider these products to have high support.The reason why I believe it has high confidence is that people who buy Protein Ice cream, Protein Bar is also likely to appear. The reason being that these two products are the most popular snacks for people that go to the gym and want extra protein. Based on my personal expereicne, Protein Bar has higher popularity than Protein Ice cream, because it is easy to carry, either to work or to the gym. So I came to the conclusion that people who buy Protein Ice Cream, are the people that cares about their diet, so they would most likely buy other protein supplements as well, such as protein bar. In conclusion, I believe {Protein Ice cream} -> {Protein Bar} is an interesting rule that might have high support and high confidence,the reason being is that I am not sure if Uncle Steve has any expereince in supplements, and I am thinking maybe provide him some insight on attracting athelete customeres. Proteins are esssential to many people that control their diet, also people who purchase Protein Ice Cream would also most likely to purcahse protein bar to keep up with their diet."

        "{Multi Vitamin} -> {Protien powder}. The reason why I find this rule interesting is that, for many people that works out and purcahse protein powder, they also cares about vitamin intake. I've never really see any discounts or promotions when these two products are purcahsed together, but I do think these two products can be interesting. The reason why I believe it has high supports, is because people that planned out their calories intake, also plans out vitamin intake. The reason why I think it might have relatives low confidence is because people who does not workout would also purchase Vitamin for different uses, so in the formula S(Multi Vitamin& Protein Powder)/S(Multi Vitamin). I believe that people who purcahse vitamin would be regular people + people that workout, but people that purchase multi Vitamins & Protein Powder would just be people that work out, so the confidecne would be realtively low.\n",

        "{Protein Powder} -> {Coke Cola} have low support and low confidence. Both of these products are really popular in the grocery store, however they would most likely not be in the same item set. It has low support because people who purcahse protein powder would consider themself to be strictly diet focused group of people, but coke cola does not do the job of helping on controlling diet. Hence it has low support. It has low confidence because, given that the support is low, given the formula for confidence is S(X&Y)/S(X), since that Protien Powder occurs often, and S(X&Y) is low, based on the formula we can also conclude confidence is also low. Although this rule is probably common for Uncle Steve, but some of the recommendation that I can give is that \n",

        "{Nespresso Coffee Machine} -> {Nespresso Coffee Pod}. Normal grocery store sells lots of options of coffee powder, and maybe some would sell a couple coffee machine or coffee pod. I think this rule would be interest for uncle Steve to see if he decides to carry these two products going foward. The reason why I believe these items have low support is because most people who buy these two products would go to a specilized coffee store such as Nespresso to pick the right machine. So the combination of it would be low. The reason why I believe this has high confidence is because people who buy coffee machine will most likely buy coffee pod because coffee pod is specilized for the machine. S(Nespresso Coffee Machine & Nespresso Coffee Pod) / s(Nespresso Coffee Machine) would be relatively high. without coffee pod, coffee machine is kind of a waste in this case. Uncle Steve can analyze the amount of coffee related product that he has revenue on, and make decisions on whether to sell more bundle with the above rule or not."

        "1. Build a baseline model - no feature engineering, no feature selection, no hyperparameter tuning (just use the default settings), nothing fancy. (You may need to do some basic feature transformations, e.g., encoding of categorical features, or dropping of features you do not think will help or do not want to deal with yet.) Measure the performance using K-fold cross validation (recommended: [`sklearn.model_selection.cross_val_score`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.cross_val_score.html#sklearn.model_selection.cross_val_score)) on the training data. Use at least 5 folds, but more are better. Choose a [`scoring` parameter](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/model_evaluation.html#scoring-parameter) (i.e., classification metric) that you feel is appropriate for this task. Don't use accuracy. Print the mean score of your model.\n",
        "2. Add a bit of feature engineering. The [`sklearn.preprocessing`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/classes.html#module-sklearn.preprocessing) module contains many useful transformations. Engineer at least three new features. They don't need to be especially ground-breaking or complicated. Dimensionality reduction techniques like [`sklearn.decomposition.PCA`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.decomposition.PCA.html) are fair game but not required. (If you do use dimensionality reduction techniques, it would only count as \"one\" new feature for the purposes of this assignment, even though I realize that PCA creates many new \"features\" (i.e., principal componentns).) Re-train your baseline model. Measure performance. Compare to step 1.\n",
        "3. Add feature selection. The [`sklearn.feature_selection`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/classes.html#module-sklearn.feature_selection) has some algorithms for you to choose from. After selecting features, re-train your model, measure performance, and compare to step 2.\n",
        "4. Add hyperparameter tuning. Make reasonable choices and try to find the best (or at least, better) hyperparameters for your estimator and/or transformers. It's probably a good idea to stop using `cross_val_score` at this point and start using [`sklearn.model_selection.GridSearchCV`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.GridSearchCV.html#sklearn.model_selection.GridSearchCV) as it is specifically built for this purpose and is more convienient to use. Measure performance and compare to step 3.\n",
        "5. Finally, estimate how well your model will work in production. Use the testing data (our \"future, unseen data\") from step 0. Transform the data as appropriate (easy if you've built a pipeline, a little more difficult if not), use the model from step 4 to get predictions, and measure the performance.

The model will alert Uncle Steve to potential turbine failures before they happen, giving Uncle Steve a chance to perform an inspection on the turbine and then fix the turbine before it fails. Uncle Steve plans to run the model every morning. For all the turbines that the model predicts will fail, Uncle Steve will order an inspection (which cost a flat \\$500, no matter if the turbine was in good health or not; the \\$500 would not be part of the $2,000 service cost). For the rest of the turbines, Uncle Steve will do nothing.\n",
